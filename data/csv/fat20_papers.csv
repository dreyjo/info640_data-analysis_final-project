0,What to account for when accounting for algorithms: a systematic literature review on algorithmic accountability,"
As research on algorithms and their impact proliferates, so do calls for scrutiny/accountability of algorithms. A systematic review of the work that has been done in the field of 'algorithmic accountability' has so far been lacking. This contribution puts forth such a systematic review, following the PRISMA statement. 242 English articles from the period 2008 up to and including 2018 were collected and extracted from Web of Science and SCOPUS, using a recursive query design coupled with computational methods. The 242 articles were prioritized and ordered using affinity mapping, resulting in 93 'core articles' which are presented in this contribution. The recursive search strategy made it possible to look beyond the term 'algorithmic accountability'. That is, the query also included terms closely connected to the theme (e.g. ethics and AI, regulation of algorithms). This approach allows for a perspective not just from critical algorithm studies, but an interdisciplinary overview drawing on material from data studies to law, and from computer science to governance studies. To structure the material, Bovens's widely accepted definition of accountability serves as a focal point. The material is analyzed on the five points Bovens identified as integral to accountability: its arguments on (1) the actor, (2) the forum, (3) the relationship between the two, (3) the content and criteria of the account, and finally (5) the consequences which may result from the account. The review makes three contributions. First, an integration of accountability theory in the algorithmic accountability discussion. Second, a cross-sectoral overview of the that same discussion viewed in light of accountability theory which pays extra attention to accountability risks in algorithmic systems. Lastly, it provides a definition of algorithmic accountability based on accountability theory and algorithmic accountability literature.

1,Algorithmic realism: expanding the boundaries of algorithmic thought,"
Although computer scientists are eager to help address social problems, the field faces a growing awareness that many well-intentioned applications of algorithms in social contexts have led to significant harm. We argue that addressing this gap between the field's desire to do good and the harmful impacts of many of its interventions requires looking to the epistemic and methodological underpinnings of algorithms. We diagnose the dominant mode of algorithmic reasoning as ""algorithmic formalism"" and describe how formalist orientations lead to harmful algorithmic interventions. Addressing these harms requires pursuing a new mode of algorithmic thinking that is attentive to the internal limits of algorithms and to the social concerns that fall beyond the bounds of algorithmic formalism. To understand what a methodological evolution beyond formalism looks like and what it may achieve, we turn to the twentieth century evolution in American legal thought from legal formalism to legal realism. Drawing on the lessons of legal realism, we propose a new mode of algorithmic thinking---""algorithmic realism""---that provides tools for computer scientists to account for the realities of social life and of algorithmic impacts. These realist approaches, although not foolproof, will better equip computer scientists to reduce algorithmic harms and to reason well about doing good.

2,Algorithmic accountability in public administration: the GDPR paradox,"
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") is often represented as a larger than life behemoth that will fundamentally transform the world of big data. Abstracted from its constituent parts of corresponding rights, responsibilities, and exemptions, the operative scope of the GDPR can be unduly aggrandized, when in reality, it caters to the specific policy objectives of legislators and institutional stakeholders. With much uncertainty ahead on the precise implementation of the GDPR, academic and policy discussions are debating the adequacy of protections for automated decision-making in GDPR Articles 13 (right to be informed of automated treatment), 15 (right of access by the data subject), and 22 (safeguards to profiling). Unfortunately, the literature to date disproportionately focuses on the impact of AI in the private sector, and deflects any extensive review of automated enforcement tools in public administration. Even though the GDPR enacts significant safeguards against automated decisions, it does so with deliberate design: to balance the interests of data protection with the growing demand for algorithms in the administrative state. In order to facilitate inter-agency data flows and sensitive data processing that fuel the predictive power of algorithmic enforcement tools, the GDPR decisively surrenders to the procedural autonomy of Member States to authorize these practices. Yet, due to a dearth of research on the GDPR's stance on government deployed algorithms, it is not widely known that public authorities can benefit from broadly worded exemptions to restrictions on automated decision-making, and even circumvent remedies for data subjects through national legislation. The potential for public authorities to invoke derogations from the GDPR must be contained by the fundamental guarantees of due process, judicial review, and equal treatment. This paper examines the interplay of these principles within the prospect of algorithmic decision-making by public authorities.

3,Closing the AI accountability gap: defining an end-to-end framework for internal algorithmic auditing,"
Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligence systems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literature in which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigators from outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source. In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.

4,Toward situated interventions for algorithmic equity: lessons from the field,"
Research to date aimed at the fairness, accountability, and transparency of algorithmic systems has largely focused on topics such as identifying failures of current systems and on technical interventions intended to reduce bias in computational processes. Researchers have given less attention to methods that account for the social and political contexts of specific, situated technical systems at their points of use. Co-developing algorithmic accountability interventions in communities supports outcomes that are more likely to address problems in their situated context and re-center power with those most disparately affected by the harms of algorithmic systems. In this paper we report on our experiences using participatory and co-design methods for algorithmic accountability in a project called the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit. The main insights we gleaned from our experiences were: (i) many meaningful interventions toward equitable algorithmic systems are non-technical; (ii) community organizations derive the most value from localized materials as opposed to what is ""scalable"" beyond a particular policy context; (iii) framing harms around algorithmic bias suggests that more accurate data is the solution, at the risk of missing deeper questions about whether some technologies should be used at all. More broadly, we found that community-based methods are important inroads to addressing algorithmic harms in their situated contexts.

5,Explainability fact sheets: a framework for systematic assessment of explainable approaches,"
Explanations in Machine Learning come in many forms, but a consensus regarding their desired properties is yet to emerge. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy and a set of descriptors that can be used to characterise and systematically assess explainable systems along five key dimensions: functional, operational, usability, safety and validation. In order to design a comprehensive and representative taxonomy and associated descriptors we surveyed the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence literature, extracting the criteria and desiderata that other authors have proposed or implicitly used in their research. The survey includes papers introducing new explainability algorithms to see what criteria are used to guide their development and how these algorithms are evaluated, as well as papers proposing such criteria from both computer science and social science perspectives. This novel framework allows to systematically compare and contrast explainability approaches, not just to better understand their capabilities but also to identify discrepancies between their theoretical qualities and properties of their implementations. We developed an operationalisation of the framework in the form of Explainability Fact Sheets, which enable researchers and practitioners alike to quickly grasp capabilities and limitations of a particular explainable method. When used as a Work Sheet, our taxonomy can guide the development of new explainability approaches by aiding in their critical evaluation along the five proposed dimensions.

6,Multi-layered explanations from algorithmic impact assessments in the GDPR,"
Impact assessments have received particular attention on both sides of the Atlantic as a tool for implementing algorithmic accountability. The aim of this paper is to address how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) (Art. 35) in the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) link the GDPR's two approaches to algorithmic accountability---individual rights and systemic governance--- and potentially lead to more accountable and explainable algorithms. We argue that algorithmic explanation should not be understood as a static statement, but as a circular and multi-layered transparency process based on several layers (general information about an algorithm, group-based explanations, and legal justification of individual decisions taken). We argue that the impact assessment process plays a crucial role in connecting internal company heuristics and risk mitigation to outward-facing rights, and in forming the substance of several kinds of explanations.

7,The hidden assumptions behind counterfactual explanations and principal reasons,"
Counterfactual explanations are gaining prominence within technical, legal, and business circles as a way to explain the decisions of a machine learning model. These explanations share a trait with the long-established ""principal reason"" explanations required by U.S. credit laws: they both explain a decision by highlighting a set of features deemed most relevant---and withholding others. These ""feature-highlighting explanations"" have several desirable properties: They place no constraints on model complexity, do not require model disclosure, detail what needed to be different to achieve a different decision, and seem to automate compliance with the law. But they are far more complex and subjective than they appear. In this paper, we demonstrate that the utility of feature-highlighting explanations relies on a number of easily overlooked assumptions: that the recommended change in feature values clearly maps to real-world actions, that features can be made commensurate by looking only at the distribution of the training data, that features are only relevant to the decision at hand, and that the underlying model is stable over time, monotonic, and limited to binary outcomes. We then explore several consequences of acknowledging and attempting to address these assumptions, including a paradox in the way that feature-highlighting explanations aim to respect autonomy, the unchecked power that feature-highlighting explanations grant decision makers, and a tension between making these explanations useful and the need to keep the model hidden. While new research suggests several ways that feature-highlighting explanations can work around some of the problems that we identify, the disconnect between features in the model and actions in the real world---and the subjective choices necessary to compensate for this---must be understood before these techniques can be usefully implemented.

8,Why does my model fail?: contrastive local explanations for retail forecasting,"
In various business settings, there is an interest in using more complex machine learning techniques for sales forecasting. It is difficult to convince analysts, along with their superiors, to adopt these techniques since the models are considered to be ""black boxes,"" even if they perform better than current models in use. We examine the impact of contrastive explanations about large errors on users' attitudes towards a ""black-box"" model. We propose an algorithm, Monte Carlo Bounds for Reasonable Predictions. Given a large error, MC-BRP determines (1) feature values that would result in a reasonable prediction, and (2) general trends between each feature and the target, both based on Monte Carlo simulations. We evaluate on a real dataset with real users by conducting a user study with 75 participants to determine if explanations generated by MC-BRP help users understand why a prediction results in a large error, and if this promotes trust in an automatically-learned model. Our study shows that users are able to answer objective questions about the model's predictions with overall 81.1% accuracy when provided with these contrastive explanations. We show that users who saw MC-BRP explanations understand why the model makes large errors in predictions significantly more than users in the control group. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of the difference in attitudes between Practitioners and Researchers, and confirm that our results hold when conditioning on the users' background.

9,"""The human body is a black box"": supporting clinical decision-making with deep learning","
Machine learning technologies are increasingly developed for use in healthcare. While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to fairness, transparency, and accountability that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain underexamined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature and provide a detailed case study covering the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sepsis Watch, a machine learning-driven tool that assists hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. Sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure or death if not treated in time and is the leading cause of inpatient deaths in US hospitals. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing solely on model interpretability to ensure fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for responsibly designing machine learning systems. Our work underscores the limits of model interpretability as a solution to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability in practice. Instead, our work demonstrates other means and goals to achieve FATML values in design and in practice.

10,Assessing algorithmic fairness with unobserved protected class using data combination,"
The increasing impact of algorithmic decisions on people's lives compels us to scrutinize their fairness and, in particular, the disparate impacts that ostensibly-color-blind algorithms can have on different groups. Examples include credit decisioning, hiring, advertising, criminal justice, personalized medicine, and targeted policymaking, where in some cases legislative or regulatory frameworks for fairness exist and define specific protected classes. In this paper we study a fundamental challenge to assessing disparate impacts, or performance disparities in general, in practice: protected class membership is often not observed in the data. This is particularly a problem in lending and healthcare. We consider the use of an auxiliary dataset, such as the US census, that includes protected class labels but not decisions or outcomes. We show that a variety of common disparity measures are generally unidentifiable aside for some unrealistic cases, providing a new perspective on the documented biases of popular proxy-based methods. We provide exact characterizations of the sharpest-possible partial identification set of disparities either under no assumptions or when we incorporate mild smoothness constraints. We further provide optimization-based algorithms for computing and visualizing these sets of simultaneously achievable pairwise disparties for assessing disparities that arise between multiple groups, which enables reliable and robust assessments - an important tool when disparity assessment can have far-reaching policy implications. We demonstrate this in two case studies with real data: mortgage lending and personalized medicine dosing.

11,FlipTest: fairness testing via optimal transport,"
We present FlipTest, a black-box technique for uncovering discrimination in classifiers. FlipTest is motivated by the intuitive question: had an individual been of a different protected status, would the model have treated them differently? Rather than relying on causal information to answer this question, FlipTest leverages optimal transport to match individuals in different protected groups, creating similar pairs of in-distribution samples. We show how to use these instances to detect discrimination by constructing a flipset: the set of individuals whose classifier output changes post-translation, which corresponds to the set of people who may be harmed because of their group membership. To shed light on why the model treats a given subgroup differently, FlipTest produces a transparency report: a ranking of features that are most associated with the model's behavior on the flipset. Evaluating the approach on three case studies, we show that this provides a computationally inexpensive way to identify subgroups that may be harmed by model discrimination, including in cases where the model satisfies group fairness criteria.

12,"Implications of AI (un-)fairness in higher education admissions: the effects of perceived AI (un-)fairness on exit, voice and organizational reputation","
Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life. In higher education, machine-learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions. Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems, fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses. The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM. That is, algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but, rather, reproduce biases existing within the respective training data. This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness. Specifically, we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness: (i) procedural fairness and (ii) distributive fairness. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 304) from a large German university, we tested whether students' assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs. human decision-making (HDM) within the higher education context. Furthermore, we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables, which are hugely important for universities: (1) exit, (2) voice, and (3) organizational reputation. The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness. Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions, we find that (1) distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system, whereas (2) only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting. Finally, (3) distributive fairness, but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation. For universities aiming to implement ADM systems, it is crucial, therefore, to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account.

13,Auditing radicalization pathways on YouTube,"
Non-profits, as well as the media, have hypothesized the existence of a radicalization pipeline on YouTube, claiming that users systematically progress towards more extreme content on the platform. Yet, there is to date no substantial quantitative evidence of this alleged pipeline. To close this gap, we conduct a large-scale audit of user radicalization on YouTube. We analyze 330,925 videos posted on 349 channels, which we broadly classified into four types: Media, the Alt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W.), and the Alt-right. According to the aforementioned radicalization hypothesis, channels in the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite serve as gateways to fringe far-right ideology, here represented by Alt-right channels. Processing 72M+ comments, we show that the three channel types indeed increasingly share the same user base; that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content; and that a large percentage of users who consume Alt-right content now consumed Alt-lite and I.D.W. content in the past. We also probe YouTube's recommendation algorithm, looking at more than 2M video and channel recommendations between May/July 2019. We find that Alt-lite content is easily reachable from I.D.W. channels, while Alt-right videos are reachable only through channel recommendations. Overall, we paint a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on YouTube.

14,Case study: predictive fairness to reduce misdemeanor recidivism through social service interventions,"
The criminal justice system is currently ill-equipped to improve outcomes of individuals who cycle in and out of the system with a series of misdemeanor offenses. Often due to constraints of caseload and poor record linkage, prior interactions with an individual may not be considered when an individual comes back into the system, let alone in a proactive manner through the application of diversion programs. The Los Angeles City Attorney's Office recently created a new Recidivism Reduction and Drug Diversion unit (R2D2) tasked with reducing recidivism in this population. Here we describe a collaboration with this new unit as a case study for the incorporation of predictive equity into machine learning based decision making in a resource-constrained setting. The program seeks to improve outcomes by developing individually-tailored social service interventions (i.e., diversions, conditional plea agreements, stayed sentencing, or other favorable case disposition based on appropriate social service linkage rather than traditional sentencing methods) for individuals likely to experience subsequent interactions with the criminal justice system, a time and resource-intensive undertaking that necessitates an ability to focus resources on individuals most likely to be involved in a future case. Seeking to achieve both efficiency (through predictive accuracy) and equity (improving outcomes in traditionally under-served communities and working to mitigate existing disparities in criminal justice outcomes), we discuss the equity outcomes we seek to achieve, describe the corresponding choice of a metric for measuring predictive fairness in this context, and explore a set of options for balancing equity and efficiency when building and selecting machine learning models in an operational public policy setting.

15,The concept of fairness in the GDPR: a linguistic and contextual interpretation,"
There is a growing attention on the notion of fairness in the GDPR in the European legal literature. However, the principle of fairness in the Data Protection framework is still ambiguous and uncertain, as computer science literature and interpretative guidelines reveal. This paper looks for a better understanding of the concept of fairness in the data protection field through two parallel methodological tools: linguistic comparison and contextual interpretation. In terms of linguistic comparison, the paper analyses all translations of the world ""fair"" in the GDPR in the EU official languages, as the CJEU suggests in CILFIT Case for the interpretation of the EU law. The analysis takes into account also the translation of the notion of fairness in other contiguous fields (e.g. at Article 8 of the EU Charter of fundamental rights or in the Consumer field, e.g. Unfair terms directive or Unfair commercial practice directive). In general, the notion of fairness is translated with several different nuances (in accordance or in discordance with the previous Data protection Directive and with Article 8 of the Charter) In some versions different words are used interchangeably (it is the case of French, Spanish and Portuguese texts), in other versions there seems to be a specific rationale for using different terms in different parts of the GDPR (it is the case of German and Greek version). The analysis reveals three mean semantic notions: correctness (Italian, Swedish, Romanian), loyalty (French, Spanish, Portuguese and the German version of ""Treu und Glaube"") and equitability (French, Spanish and Portuguese). Interestingly, these three notions have common roots in the Western legal history: the Roman law notion of ""bona fide"". Taking into account both the value of ""bona fide"" in the current European legal contexts and also a contextual interpretation of the role of fairness in the GDPR, the preliminary conclusions is that fairness refers to a substantial balancing of interests among data controllers and data subjects. The approach of fairness is effect-based: what is relevant is not the formal respect of procedures (in terms of transparency, lawfulness or accountability), but the substantial mitigation of unfair imbalances that create situations of ""vulnerability"". Building on these reflections, the paper analyses how the notion of fairness and imbalance are related to the idea of vulnerability, within and beyond the GDPR. In sum, the article suggests that the best interpretation of the fairness principles in the GDPR (taking into account both the notion of procedural fairness and of fair balancing) is the mitigation of data subjects' vulnerabilities through specific safeguards and measures.

17,POTs: protective optimization technologies,"
Algorithmic fairness aims to address the economic, moral, social, and political impact that digital systems have on populations through solutions that can be applied by service providers. Fairness frameworks do so, in part, by mapping these problems to a narrow definition and assuming the service providers can be trusted to deploy countermeasures. Not surprisingly, these decisions limit fairness frameworks' ability to capture a variety of harms caused by systems. We characterize fairness limitations using concepts from requirements engineering and from social sciences. We show that the focus on algorithms' inputs and outputs misses harms that arise from systems interacting with the world; that the focus on bias and discrimination omits broader harms on populations and their environments; and that relying on service providers excludes scenarios where they are not cooperative or intentionally adversarial. We propose Protective Optimization Technologies (POTs). POTs, provide means for affected parties to address the negative impacts of systems in the environment, expanding avenues for political contestation. POTs intervene from outside the system, do not require service providers to cooperate, and can serve to correct, shift, or expose harms that systems impose on populations and their environments. We illustrate the potential and limitations of POTs in two case studies: countering road congestion caused by traffic beating applications, and recalibrating credit scoring for loan applicants.

18,Fair decision making using privacy-protected data,"
Data collected about individuals is regularly used to make decisions that impact those same individuals. We consider settings where sensitive personal data is used to decide who will receive resources or benefits. While it is well known that there is a trade-off between protecting privacy and the accuracy of decisions, we initiate a first-of-its-kind study into the impact of formally private mechanisms (based on differential privacy) on fair and equitable decision-making. We empirically investigate novel tradeoffs on two real-world decisions made using U.S. Census data (allocation of federal funds and assignment of voting rights benefits) as well as a classic apportionment problem. Our results show that if decisions are made using an ∈-differentially private version of the data, under strict privacy constraints (smaller ∈), the noise added to achieve privacy may disproportionately impact some groups over others. We propose novel measures of fairness in the context of randomized differentially private algorithms and identify a range of causes of outcome disparities. We also explore improved algorithms to remedy the unfairness observed.

Motivated by concerns surrounding the fairness effects of sharing and transferring fair machine learning tools, we propose two algorithms: Fairness Warnings and Fair-MAML. The first is a model-agnostic algorithm that provides interpretable boundary conditions for when a fairly trained model may not behave fairly on similar but slightly different tasks within a given domain. The second is a fair meta-learning approach to train models that can be quickly fine-tuned to specific tasks from only a few number of sample instances while balancing fairness and accuracy. We demonstrate experimentally the individual utility of each model using relevant baselines and provide the first experiment to our knowledge of K-shot fairness, i.e. training a fair model on a new task with only K data points. Then, we illustrate the usefulness of both algorithms as a combined method for training models from a few data points on new tasks while using Fairness Warnings as interpretable boundary conditions under which the newly trained model may not be fair.

22,"Whose side are ethics codes on?: power, responsibility and the social good","
The moral authority of ethics codes stems from an assumption that they serve a unified society, yet this ignores the political aspects of any shared resource. The sociologist Howard S. Becker challenged researchers to clarify their power and responsibility in the classic essay: Whose Side Are We On. Building on Becker's hierarchy of credibility, we report on a critical discourse analysis of data ethics codes and emerging conceptualizations of beneficence, or the ""social good"", of data technology. The analysis revealed that ethics codes from corporations and professional associations conflated consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. Interviews with community organizers about social change in the digital era supplement the analysis, surfacing the limits of technical solutions to concerns of marginalized communities. Given evidence that highlights the gulf between the documents and lived experiences, we argue that ethics codes that elevate consumers may simultaneously subordinate the needs of vulnerable populations. Understanding contested digital resources is central to the emerging field of public interest technology. We introduce the concept of digital differential vulnerability to explain disproportionate exposures to harm within data technology and suggest recommendations for future ethics codes..

23,"Algorithmic targeting of social policies: fairness, accuracy, and distributed governance","
Targeted social policies are the main strategy for poverty alleviation across the developing world. These include targeted cash transfers (CTs), as well as targeted subsidies in health, education, housing, energy, childcare, and others. Due to the scale, diversity, and widespread relevance of targeted social policies like CTs, the algorithmic rules that decide who is eligible to benefit from them---and who is not---are among the most important algorithms operating in the world today. Here we report on a year-long engagement towards improving social targeting systems in a couple of developing countries. We demonstrate that a shift towards the use of AI methods in poverty-based targeting can substantially increase accuracy, extending the coverage of the poor by nearly a million people in two countries, without increasing expenditure. However, we also show that, absent explicit parity constraints, both status quo and AI-based systems induce disparities across population subgroups. Moreover, based on qualitative interviews with local social institutions, we find a lack of consensus on normative standards for prioritization and fairness criteria. Hence, we close by proposing a decision-support platform for distributed governance, which enables a diversity of institutions to customize the use of AI-based insights into their targeting decisions.

24,Roles for computing in social change,"
A recent normative turn in computer science has brought concerns about fairness, bias, and accountability to the core of the field. Yet recent scholarship has warned that much of this technical work treats problematic features of the status quo as fixed, and fails to address deeper patterns of injustice and inequality. While acknowledging these critiques, we posit that computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems --- roles whose value can be recognized even from a perspective that aspires toward fundamental social change. In this paper, we articulate four such roles, through an analysis that considers the opportunities as well as the significant risks inherent in such work. Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming computing's capacity to solve social problems on its own.

Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming computing's capacity to solve social problems on its own.

26,The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies,"
To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.

27,The philosophical basis of algorithmic recourse,"
Philosophers have established that certain ethically important values are modally robust in the sense that they systematically deliver correlative benefits across a range of counterfactual scenarios. In this paper, we contend that recourse - the systematic process of reversing unfavorable decisions by algorithms and bureaucracies across a range of counterfactual scenarios - is such a modally robust good. In particular, we argue that two essential components of a good life - temporally extended agency and trust - are underwritten by recourse. We critique existing approaches to the conceptualization, operationalization and implementation of recourse. Based on these criticisms, we suggest a revised approach to recourse and give examples of how it might be implemented - especially for those who are least well off1.

29,Effect of confidence and explanation on accuracy and trust calibration in AI-assisted decision making,"
Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately calibrate human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.
